Let's think for a moment. 

First, you should check if number is too left or too right. Each of these can be variables.

*****
*365*
*****

****
*36*
****

***
*3*
***

The mathematical pattern seems to be that you want to repeat 
(left - 1, ((len(char) + 1) - right)) times, given that
left and right being true should be a value of 1. 

For checking current line:

*365*
*36*
*3*

Checking left is always index - 1

What about right? it is index + len(char)
