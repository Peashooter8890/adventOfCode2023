# Mark's Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This is my advent of code solutions for 2023. 

My solutions are garbage, but I am going to cope with the fact that I'm just doing this for fun. But to be fair, even when I'm trying to code very seriously, my code comes out bad. But that's ok - I've reached the final point in my five stages of programming grief, which is acceptance of writing bad code.

Generally, whenever I try to code something first try, what happens is that mid way through a bug will occur and it will tell me that I could have wrote this program in a better way. Instead of rewriting the program then and there, I make myself a victim of Sunk-Cost Fallacy and just keep adding onto my code. Eventually, this will make my code reminds me of a hundred different wires that are tangled with each other and in all sorts of bad knots.

Later on, I might revisit my code and refactor it to make it less trash. But note that even then, it will be bad code. So I will then have to visit other people's solutions to learn from much better code than my small brain can generate. Though, at that point, I won't rewrite my code to emulate other peoples' code - I will simply store the new solution in my brain, maybe write a paragraph explaining what it does (for better memory) and hope that it will better my future code. 

Why did I write this rant for a simple README? I wrote it because I can and I want to. If you have complaints, please submit them NOWHERE. I am not a company that will pretend to care about your complaints and makes an entire cutting-edge technology CSS webpage form for it just for no one to actually read them when someone submits a complaint. Whatever you say, this rant is not going to get deleted, so deal with it. I am pretty sure that no one is going to see this though - but in the off chance that they do, I have no idea why you have read this far and I must commend you for your ability to waste your time on a random github README page that does not state anything productive, and I am displeased to inform you that there is nothing I can give you for having read this.
